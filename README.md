# sedatar - semantic data access and retrieval
This repository contains a web front-end for an astronomical database to be used together with the
yet to be specified sedatar (semantic data access and retrival) project.

Its main purpose is probably to provide simple schematic depictions of known planetary systems,
alongside with the additional information about the planets and their host stars stored in the
database.

Planetary and stellar data is provided by [NASA's exoplanet
archive](http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu) and is taken 'as is'. This is a hobbyist project
and makes no claims about being complete, correct or consistent.

You are welcome to visit the website at [https://sedatar.herokuapp.com](https://sedatar.herokuapp.com).
So far, it has been tested only with Chrome 86+.
